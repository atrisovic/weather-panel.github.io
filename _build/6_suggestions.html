<h1 id="6.-Suggestions-when-producing-a-panel-dataset">6. Suggestions when producing a panel dataset<a class="anchor-link" href="#6.-Suggestions-when-producing-a-panel-dataset"> </a></h1><p>Keep your code and your data separate. A typical file organization will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>code/</code> - all of your analysis</li>
<li><code>sources/</code> - the original data files, along with information so you can find them again</li>
<li><code>data/</code> - merged datasets that are ready to be analyzed</li>
<li><code>results/</code> - result files, typically not formatted for display.</li>
<li><code>figures/</code> - formatted figures and LaTeX tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you arenâ€™t sure what predictors you will need for your analysis,
create your dataset with a lot of possible predictors and decide
later.  Often merging together your panel dataset is laborious, and
you do not want to do it more times than necessary.</p>
