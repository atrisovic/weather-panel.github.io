<h1 id="5.-Generating-geographical-unit-data">5. Generating geographical unit data<a class="anchor-link" href="#5.-Generating-geographical-unit-data"> </a></h1><p>A geographical unit, area or region, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration, and as such, it is a common unit for recording economic outcome data.  These geographic regions may be defined in subtle, non-intuitive ways.  For example, a “city” is a local administrative unit where the majority of the population lives in an urban center, while the “greater city” is an approximation of the urban center beyond of the administrative city boundaries<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/cities/spatial-units">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>One kind of geographic region is simply called an "administrative
unit", and refers to states and provinces, or counties and
municipalities. The top level of this hierarchy of administrative
units is "ADM0", referring to countries; "ADM1" is the first level of
political division, usually called states or provinces; "ADM2" is the
second level of division, and has a wider range of names across the
globe.
 Administrative units in economics analyses are typically politically-defined regions, rather than regular grids, because socioeconomic data is collected and corresponding to the political regions. They can also be more effective for communicating results, since politically defined regions are also more relevant for policy-makers.</p>
<p>Administrative unit data can capture existing administrative units (high granularity) or groups of those units (lesser granularity). For example, the administrative unit database, <a href="https://gadm.org">Global Administrative Regions</a>, offers a granularity of 386,735 administrative areas for the entire world, that can be grouped according to the needs of a study.
When aggregating administrative units, it is important to capture
territories with homogeneous features that are relevant to the
study. For example, if the weather is relevant for the study, the
administrative unit should be fairly homogeneous concerning mean temperature and precipitation.</p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/reep/article/7/2/181/1522753">Using Weather Data and Climate Model Output in Economic Analyses of Climate Change</a> describes
the common pitfalls in translating weather data into geographical unit data.</p>
<h2 id="Geographic-information-systems">Geographic information systems<a class="anchor-link" href="#Geographic-information-systems"> </a></h2><p>Much is made of geographic information system (GIS), but these have
long since become unnotably common parts of spatial research. GIS
refers to the representation of polygons, curves, and points, and
their use in data analysis.</p>
<p>Describing shapes requires specialized data formats. The most common
data format is an ESRI Shapefile, and we will focus on these for this
tutorial. You may also encounter GDB (common in hydrology), GeoJSON
(used with web interfaces), KXML (used by Google Earth), and OSM (from
OpenStreetMap) files. All of these can be converted to Shapefiles,
using GIS software like QGIS.</p>
<p>A shapefile also stores geometry and attribute information for the spatial features in a data set. The geometry for a feature is stored as a shape comprising a vector of coordinates. Area features are represented as a closed-loop, double-digitized polygons. The shapes together with data attributes linked to each shape create the representation of geographic data like countries, rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>Despite its name indicating a singular file, a shapefile is actually a collection of at least three basic files that need to be stored in the same directory to be used. The three mandatory files have filename extensions <code>.shp</code>, <code>.shx</code> and <code>.dbf</code>. There may be additional files like <code>.prj</code> with the shape file’s projection information. All files must have the same name, for example:</p>

<pre><code>states.shp
states.shx
states.dbf</code></pre>
<p>Technical description for shapefiles can be found <a href="https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf"><em>HERE</em></a></p>
<h2 id="Finding-shapefiles">Finding shapefiles<a class="anchor-link" href="#Finding-shapefiles"> </a></h2><p>It is usually possible to find a shapefile corresponding to a set of
socioeconomic data by searching around online. Many governments will
have an internal search engine for their GIS data. Two frequently
useful resources are
the <a href="https://gadm.org">Global Administrative Regions</a> database, which
has standard administrative units across the globe,
and <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a> which has
clean physical shape information.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-shapefiles">Creating shapefiles<a class="anchor-link" href="#Creating-shapefiles"> </a></h2><p>In some cases, you will have to make the shapefile from scratch. The
most common ways of doing this is by clicking out the shape of each
polygon. This generally requires a few steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an image that shows the regions that you want to digitize and
import the image into QGIS or ArcGIS.</li>
<li>Typically, published images will not report the projection that was
used, but you will need to find a mapping between points in the
image and latitude-longitude coordinates. Use
the
<a href="https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/georeferencing_basics.html">GDAL Georeferencer</a> to
make this a point-and-click task.</li>
<li>Create new polygons by clicking around the edges of the polygon.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Working-with-shapefiles">Working with shapefiles<a class="anchor-link" href="#Working-with-shapefiles"> </a></h2><p>Your first step should be to view your shapefile in a software system
like QGIS or ArcGIS.
QGIS is a free and open-source desktop geographic information system application that supports viewing, editing and analysis of geospatial data. ArcGIS is a proprietary software for working with maps and geographic data.</p>
<p>These systems also allow you to perform many kinds of spatial
analysis. Some of the most commonly useful are calculating Zonal
Statistics, such as the average of a gridded dataset across each
shapefile region, and Merging units, and translating points to
polygons with Voronoi Polygons.</p>
<p>Shapefiles can be opened with Python packages like the following</p>

<h2 id="Weighted-aggregations-within-spatial-units">Weighted aggregations within spatial units<a class="anchor-link" href="#Weighted-aggregations-within-spatial-units"> </a></h2><h2 id="Matching-names">Matching names<a class="anchor-link" href="#Matching-names"> </a></h2><p>It is often necessary to match names within two datasets with geographical unit observations. For example, a country’s statistics ministry may report values by administrative unit, but to find out the actual spatial extent of those units, you may need to use the GADM shapefiles.</p>
<p>Matching observations by name can be annoyingly time-consuming. These problems even exist at the level of countries, where, for example, North Korea is regularly listed as “Democratic People's Republic of Korea”, “Korea, North”, and “Korea, Dem. Rep.”; and information is indiscriminately reported for isolated regions or sovereign states (Guadeloupe’s data may or may not be included in France). Reporting units may not correspond to standard administrative units at all, and you will need to aggregate or disaggregate regions to match between datasets.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions for dealing with the mess that is political geography:</p>
<p>First, try to perform all merging on abbreviation codes rather than names. At the level of countries, use <a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm">ISO alpha-3 codes</a> if possible.</p>
<p>Second, use fuzzy string matching. However, in this case, you will need to inspect all of the matches to make sure that they are correct.</p>
<p>Third, construct “translation functions” for each dataset, which map the regional names in that dataset to a canonical list of region names. I usually choose the names in one dataset as my canonical list, and name the matching functions as <code>&lt;dataset&gt;2canonical</code> and <code>canonical2&lt;dataset2&gt;</code>.</p>
