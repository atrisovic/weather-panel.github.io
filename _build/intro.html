<h1 id="Books-with-Jupyter-and-Jekyll">Books with Jupyter and Jekyll<a class="anchor-link" href="#Books-with-Jupyter-and-Jekyll"> </a></h1><p><img src="https://circleci.com/gh/jupyter/jupyter-book.svg?style=svg" class="left"></p>
<p>Jupyter Book lets you build an online book using a collection of Jupyter Notebooks
and Markdown files. Its output is similar to the excellent <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">Bookdown</a> tool,
and adds extra functionality for people running a Jupyter stack.</p>
<p>For an example of a book built with Jupyter Book, see the <a href="https://www.textbook.ds100.org/">textbook for Data 100</a> at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Here are a few features of Jupyter Book</p>
<ul>
<li>All course content is written in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, stored in <code>notebooks/</code></li>
<li>The Jupyter Book repo comes packaged with helper scripts to convert these into Jekyll pages (in <code>scripts/</code>) that can be hosted for free on GitHub</li>
<li>Pages can have <a href="https://mybinder.org">Binder</a> or JupyterHub links automatically added for interactivity.</li>
<li>The website itself is based on Jekyll, and is highly extensible and can be freely-hosted on GitHub.</li>
<li>There are lots of nifty HTML features under-the-hood, such as Turbolinks fast-navigation and
click-to-copy in code cells.</li>
</ul>
