<p>This section describes some of the considerations that go into
developing a <a class="reference external" href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/86004/what-is-simply-meant-by-reduced-form">reduced-form specification</a> using weather <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data">panel data</a>. Our discussion here will be very practical and limited to nonlinear panel regressions.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">See also</p>
<p>See also <a class="reference external" href="https://academic.oup.com/reep/article/14/1/1/5718007">Estimating the Economic Impacts of Climate Change Using Weather Observations</a> for a review of the available econometric techniques and their strengths and weaknesses.  For an extensive review of the results available from
the climate econometric literature and the empirical methods used to
identify them, a good resource is <a class="reference external" href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/aad9837">Social and Economic Impacts of Climate</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The key decision points in this section will be as follows:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Decide what weather variables (e.g. temperature, precipitation, etc.) to use in the analysis, and in what form (e.g. average, maximum, or minimum for temperature variable).</p></li>
<li><p>Settle on the temporal scale (e.g. days, months, years, etc.) for the analysis. It is generally decided based on how frequently we expect the responses on our dependent variable to change and the temporal scale of other datasets we intend to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose what scheme to use for the spatial aggregation. We can choose either <em>aggregation-before-transformation</em> or <em>transformation-before-aggregation</em> depending on what scale the process we are interested in, is actually occurring.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide on what <em>functional forms</em> to use in the analysis. It is always good to experiment with multiple functional forms and then decide on the main specification depending on which of them provides the best linear approximation of the true process.</p></li>
<li><p>Use cross-validation to converge on the most-preferred specification. It is always a good strategy to show results for other specification for attesting the robustness of results.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="choosing-weather-variables-and-their-forms">
<h2>Choosing weather variables and their forms<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-weather-variables-and-their-forms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The choice of weather variables depends on the question we are trying
to answer, and there are many forms to represent any given
variable. For example, in the case of temperature, we can use
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{avg}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{min}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{max}\)</span>, days above 30 C, heating and cooling
degree-days, or growing degree-days. Morevoer, it is very important to
first think about possible <em>mechanism(s)</em> behind a change witnessed in
the environment, and then only make choices for variables that can
explain that mechanism. A few of the important and frequently-used
weather variables are listed below, and why we might choose them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Temperature:</strong> Temperature relationships are often preferred in
climate impacts research, because temperature is more predictable
than many other weather variables. There are various measures of temperature that can be used. Some of them are listed below:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><em><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{min}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{max}\)</span>:</em>  Many socioeconomic processes are more
sensitive to extreme temperatures than to variation in the
average. This is also useful when temperature variation is
large, leading to significant differences in the cold end and hot end responses. These are important metrics when heterogeneity within time units matters, and may better capture heat waves and cold spells. Also, note that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{min}\)</span> better reflects nighttime temperatures while <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{max}\)</span> better reflects daytime temperatures. Not all datasets include <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{min}\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{max}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><em><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{avg}\)</span>:</em>  A good mean metric for seeing average response
over the temperature support, when there is not much variation
in temperature within each time unit considered in the
study. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{avg}\)</span> is most appropriate when there is some natural
inertia in the response, so that the dependent variable is
responding to a kind of average over the last 24 hours. Note
that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{avg}\)</span> is often just equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((T_{min} + T_{max}) / 2\)</span>, unless calculated from sub-daily data.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.degreedays.net/introduction"><em>HDD/CDD &amp; GDD:</em></a>
Degree days (DD) are a measure of ’how much’ and for ’how long’
the outside air temperature was above or below a certain
level. A sinusoid between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{min}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{max}\)</span> can be used
to approximate DDs from daily data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Heat Index &amp; Wet Bulb Temperature</em>: (see below on humidity)</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Humidity:</strong> There are mainly three metrics for humidity
measurements: absolute, relative (often “RH”), and
specific. Absolute humidity describes the water content of air,
expressed in grams per cubic metre or grams per kilogram. Relative
humidity is expressed as a percentage relative to a maximum humidity
value for a given temperature. Specific humidity is the ratio of water vapor mass to total moist air parcel mass. Human (and animal) bodies rely on evaporative cooling to regulate temperature in hot weather, the effectiveness of which depends on how much more moisture the atmosphere can currently hold (1 - RH). As a result, various temperature-humidity metrics have been developed to estimate “apparent” temperature, i.e. the temperature the current weather “feels like”:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><em>Wet-Bulb Temperature (WBT)</em>: the temperature read by a thermometer covered in water-soaked cloth (wet-bulb thermometer) over which air is passed. Gives the lowest temperature that can be reached under current conditions by evaporative cooling only. Equals air temperature at 100% relative humidity, and is lower at lower humidity.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)</em>: a weighted index that combines WBT with measures of the impact of direct radiative transfer (e.g. sunlight)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Heat Index (HI)</em>: various calculated metrics combining shade temperature and relative humidity</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Precipitation:</strong> highly local (in space <em>and</em> time), non-normally distributed i.e. often takes extremely low or high values (especially compared to temperature), poorly measured, and poorly predicted (see <a class="reference external" href="#1.5-A-Warning-on-Hydrological-Variables-(Precipitation,-Humidity,-etc.)">Section 1.5</a>. Precipitation is often used as a control since it is correlated with temperature. However, the strength and direction of this correlation varies significantly by region and time of year (see e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005GL022760">Trenberth et al. 2005</a>, with implications for collinearity). Furthermore, the same care should be taken when inserting precipitation into a model as any other weather or social variable - what is its expected role? In what form should the data be? etc. Precipitation affects society differently at different spatiotemporal scales - annual precipitation may be useful for studying snowpack trends, drinking water supply, or the effect of droughts on agriculture; maximum precipitation rates may be the relevant metric for flood damages or crop failures. Remember that though means and extremes may be correlated, it’s still possible to have a record storm in an unnaturally dry year, or an unnaturally wet year without heavy precipitation. As a result, different metrics of precipitation are often used (incomplete list):</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><em>Total precipitation (e.g., over a year)</em>: May be useful for large-scale impacts such as snowpack trends. Often used as a control in responses to extreme weather, despite being unsuited to studying short-term phenomena.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Soil water, potential evapotranspiration rate (PET), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and water runoff/availability</em>: often used to capture water stress.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Number of of rainy/dry days, or moments of the precipitation distribution</em>: the distribution of precipitation often matters more than total.
Some datasets (such as <a class="reference external" href="https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/hadex2-gridded-temperature-and-precipitation-climate-extremes-indices-climdex-data">HadEX2</a>) specialize in extremes data.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>River discharge rate:</strong> River flows are generally measured at the station-level. While runoff is avaialble in gridded products, it is not a good reflection of water availability. Hydrological models (like VIC) can translate precipitation into river discharges across a region.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wind speed:</strong> The process of interest determines how wind speeds should be measured. For example, normal speeds are important for agriculture, squared speeds for distructive force, and cubic speeds for wind turbine power. Also consider gust velocity, which is generally available. Maximum wind speed over some time period has been used as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Net primary productivity (NPP):</strong> It is the difference of amount of carbon dioxide that vegetation takes in during photosynthesis and the amount of carbon dioxide released during respiration. The data come from MODIS on NASA’s Terra satellite. Values range from near 0 g of carbon/area/day (tan) to 6.5 g of carbon/area/day (dark green). A negative value means decomposition or respiration overpowered carbon absorption; more carbon was released to the atmosphere than the plants took in.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evapotranspiration rate (ET):</strong> It is the sum of evaporation and
plant transpiration from the Earth’s land and ocean surface to the
atmosphere. Changes in ET are estimated using water stress measures
in plants, and are related to the agricultural productivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solar radiation:</strong> Shortwave radiation (visible light) contains a lot of energy; longwave radiation (infrared light) contains less energy than shortwave radiation. The sun emits shortwave radiation because it is extremely hot, while the Earth re-emits heat it receives as longwave radiation in the form of infrared rays. Exposure of shortwave radiation is said to cause skin cancer, eye damage, etc. However, UV (shortwave) radiation is important for regulating vitamin D circulation in our body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean temperature:</strong> SST is the water temperature close to the ocean’s surface, while ocean temperature is related to ocean heat content, an important topic in the study of global warming. Weather satellites have been available to determine SST information since 1967. NASA and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST satellites have been providing global SST data since 2000, available with a day lag. Though SST has a large impact on global weather patterns, other metrics (such as El Niño indices - ENSO3.4, etc. - or various other oscillation indices) may be more useful in understanding its impact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Climatic indicies:</strong> A wide range of metrics have been developed
to understand the state of the ocean-atmosphere system at large
scales. These are measured in a standardized way (e.g., by comparing
temperature at two points or by extracting a mean over a region),
and often have long time-series, often at the monthly
level. However, they do not vary over space. Data for some of the
most important are available
through <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/">NOAA</a>.  Some of
the most important are:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><em>El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</em>: Affects temperature
and precipitation across the globe, with hotspots on most
continents. For some applications, the value of the signal
will be less important than the identification of El Niño and
La Niña phases. These phases can be somewhat predicted months
in advance. El Niño events can be subclassified as Modoki or
not.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)</em>: IOD has affects weather
throughout East Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and
Oceania.</p></li>

study of the “true model”, or data-generating process, that relates
our dependent variable to our weather variables. A crucial aspect of
that relationship is the question of scale.</p>
<p>Weather data products are generally available in <em>gridded</em> form,
developed through careful interpolation and/or reanalysis. The grids
used can vary in size across datasets, but they can be aggregated to
administrative units like county, city, etc., using appropriate
weighted aggregation methods. Think about the scale of
administrative units, relative to the scale of the grid cells. If the
regions are much bigger than the grid cells, a weighted average across
included cells is appropriate. If the regions are much smaller than
the cells, it will probably be necessary to aggregate the regions,
since the level of variation is only at the grid cell level. If the
two are of similar sizes, it may be necessary to account for the
amount of each grid cell lies within each region. This can be
calculated as a transformation matrix, with a row for each region and
a column for each cell. Once the matrix is calculated, it can be
reused for each time step. More details for this process are described
in sections 3 and 5.</p>
<p>Typically, relating weather to a dependent variable requires some kind
of non-linear transformation. For example, estimating a polynomial
functional form requires raising the temperatures to various powers.
Importantly, the square of a weighted average of grid-level temperatures
is not the same as the weighted average of the square of grid-level temperatures.</p>
<p>While doing the spatial aggregation, we need to decide whether we want
to transform the data first and then aggregate it
(transformation-before-aggregation) or aggregate it and then transform
it (aggregation-before-transformation). This decision is based on
whether the phenomenon in consideration is occurring at the local
(grid or individual) scale or at the larger administrative units
(country, state, county, etc.) scale. Also, it matters what variable
is under consideration. For example, doing
aggregation-before-transformation for temperature will distort the
signal less that doing it for precipitation. This is because
precipitation is highly local both temporally and spatially; it could
rain for &lt;1 min in &lt;1 km radius area.</p>

<h3>Transformation-before-aggregation<a class="headerlink" href="#transformation-before-aggregation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When an economic process is occurring at the local level (for example,
for individuals or households), we need to first do our estimation at
the grid level. For example, to estimate the effect of temperature on
human mortality at the county level, we should reckon that the effect
of temperature on mortality is a local phenomenon, so the estimation
should happen at the lowest possible level.  Since the dependent
variable is a sum of individual-level outcomes, we should write down
the reduced-form specification for an individual experiencing
high-resolution weather, and then sum across all of those reduced
forms. The result is that we need to do any non-linear transformation of our weather variables at the grid level, then aggregate these values using a weighted averaging method, and feed these into our estimation procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical formulation for transformation-before-aggregation method</strong></p>
<p>We want to understand how local agents respond to weather shocks. Suppose that there exists an agent-level dose-response curve, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{js} = f(T_{ps})\)</span>, for a socioeconomic outcome for agent <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>, where the temperature affecting agents is in grid cell <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> and occurs in timestep <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> (e.g., if the agents respond on a day-by-day basis, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{ps}\)</span> is the local weather for a single day).</p>
<p>However, we do not observe agent-level responses. Instead, we have region-wide sums, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{it}\)</span> for region <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and reporting period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{js}\)</span> is death risk for agent <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> for a given day, we may only observe total deaths across a region in each year, $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{it} = \sum_{s \in t} \sum_{j \in i} y_{js}.\)</span>$</p>
<p>We can determine the agent-level response <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(T_{ps})\)</span> if we assume
linearity. First, let us represent this as if we could run a regression with agent-level data, breaking up the dose-response
curve into a sum of terms:<br />
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(T_{ps}) = \beta_1 g_1(T_{ps}) + \beta_2 g_2(T_{ps}) + \cdots + \beta_k g_k(T_{ps})\)</span>$</p>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_k(T_{ps})\)</span> is a transformation of the weather variables. For example, for a cubic response curve, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_1(T_{ps}) = T_{ps}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_2(T_{ps}) = T_{ps}^2\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_3(T_{ps}) = T_{ps}^3\)</span>.</p>
<p>We know that<br />
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{it} = \sum_{s\in t} \sum_{j\in i} y_{js} = \sum_{s\in t} \sum_{p\in i}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_1 g_1(T_{ps}) + \beta_2 g_2(T_{ps}) + \cdots + \beta_k g_k(T_{ps})\)</span>$</p>
<p>We can rearrange this to<br />
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{it} = \beta_1 (\sum_{s\in t} \sum_{p\in i} g_1(T_{ps})) + \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_2 (\sum_{s\in t} \sum_{p\in i} g_2(T_{ps})) + \cdots + \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_k (\sum_{s\in t} \sum_{p\in i} g_k(T_{ps}))\)</span>$</p>
<p>That is, the variables used in the regression should be the sum over
weather data that has been transformed at the grid level.</p>

<h3>Aggregation-before-transformation<a class="headerlink" href="#aggregation-before-transformation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When an economic process is occurring at the regional level, we need
to first aggregate weather variable to that level before transforming
it. For example, to estimate the effect of storm events on public
service employment at the administrative office level, we need to take
into account the fact that hiring/firing of public service employees
happens at the office level only.  Estimating grid-level effects will
lead to wrong estimation, as it should result in zero estimate for
those (almost all) grid cells which do not contain administrative
offices, and extremely large values for those (very few) cells, which
do.</p>
<p>Using the formulation above, here we would regress:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{it} = \beta_1 g_1(\sum_{s\in t} \sum_{p\in i} T_{ps}) + \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_2 g_2(\sum_{s\in t} \sum_{p\in i} T_{ps}) + \cdots + \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_k g_k(\sum_{s\in t} \sum_{p\in i} T_{ps})\)</span>$</p>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{ps}\)</span> is the gridded weather for cell <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> in time step
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_k(\cdot)\)</span> is the non-linear transformation (e.g., raising to
powers for polynomials), and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{it}\)</span> is the dependent variable
observed for region <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> in reporting period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. Weather data products can have temporal resolution finer than scale of daily observations. Like spatial aggregation, we can do temporal aggregation to month, year, or decade.</p>
